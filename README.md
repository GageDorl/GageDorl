## About Me
Hello everyone, my name is Gage D'Orlando and I have been coding and learning Web Development for around 6 years now. I started off working in Dreamweaver, but didn't like the limitations that it had, so I decided to learn to code by hand.

## Technologies
Some of the technologies I've worked with before are:
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
* Node.JS
* ReactJS
* AngularJS
* SQL
* Python
* PlaidAPI
* Chart.js
* Java

## Projects
Some of my more recent projects are included below:

* [ChewCheck](https://chewcheck.netlify.app/) - A web app that is used to help track your macronutrient data along with your weight to help you keep them in balance
* [webdevsociety Site](https://web-design-development-society.github.io/webdevsociety/) - A site made to help the webdevsociety of BYUI have some public information available to those who are interested in it
* [sp4cew4lk4](https://sp4cew4lk4.net/) - A website built for a budding content creator who hopes to sell FLStudio plugins and gain space in the content creation industry
